# Ingredients
- 14oz Coconut milk - refrigerate overnight so that the fat separates
- 3tbsp~ Thai curry paste (red, green, massaman)
    - Making this from scratch and authentic is a bit annoying, procuring the ingredients is tough
- 1cup broth
- 3 clove minced garlic
- 1-inch ginger grated
- 1tbsp neutral oil
- Thai basil

### Veggies
- Bell peppers
- Baby corn
- Snow peas
- Broccoli
- Onions
- Carrots
- Sweet Potato
- Tofu (ideally well grilled or fried)
- 1 stalk lemongrass, peeled, thinly sliced and bruised (just the stalk near the roots)


### Optional
- 1-2tbsp Tomato paste
- Toasted cashews
- 1Tbsp fish sauce or 1Tsp worcester (I use vegan worcester)
- Chicken

# Steps
- Heat the oil
- [OPTIONAL] Chicken or beef would go in here if you were using it, 5min~ and get a nice sear, then remove
- Aromatize the ginger, garlic, lemongrass
- Turn down to medium-high, toss in the fat at the top of the coconut milk, bring to a boil and look for a separation between milk and fat (clear layer on the top)
- Throw in the 3tbsp~ curry paste (and optional 1-2tbsp tomato paste), simmer for 5min
- Throw in the vegetables, 1cup broth, tofu or meat, and the rest of the coconut milk
    - Cook until vegetables are desired texture (not too soft)
    - It sometimes makes sense to put some of the tougher vegetable in earlier
- [OPTIONAL] 1Tbsp Fish sauce or 1Tsp worcester
- Garnish with Thai basil, toasted cashew
- Serve on rice

# Remarks
- Tomato paste turns everything into a red curry, but adds a lot of depth. Recommended
