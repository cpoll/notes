# Ingredients
- 14oz Coconut milk

### Optional
- 1-2tbsp Tomato paste
- 2 stalk lemongrass, bruised

# Steps
- Heat the oil
- Aromatize the ginger and garlic
- [OPTIONAL] Chicken or beef would go in here if you were using it, 5min~ and get a nice sear, then remove
- Turn down to medium-high, toss in the coconut milk, boil until there's a separation between milk and fat
- Throw in the 3tbsp~ curry paste (and optional 1-2tbsp tomato paste), simmer for 5min
- Throw in the vegetables and 1cup broth (and tofu or meat), cook until desired texture (not too soft)
