This is basically Kenji's recipe. Making risotto in a pressure cooker or instant pot is super convenient. My notes are for pressure cooker, but you can adapt. If you make this in a pot, make sure to stir enough, risotto is temperamental :)

# Ingredients
- 6 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium shallot, finely minced (about 1/4 cup)
- 3 cloves minced garlic
- 2 cups risotto rice
- 3/4 cup dry sake (drink the rest :))
  - There's no reason why you can't sub a white wine here (or probably a red)
  - TODO: Look into the process happening here, i.e. would there be any point to use vodka?
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 1/4 cup white or yellow miso paste (red works fine too)
- 4 cups low-sodium stock (veggie, chicken)
  - TODO: Try a strong beef stock with some wine, like a risotto French onion soup
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
- Kosher salt
- Minced fresh chives or scallions, for serving
- OPTIONAL: Parmigiano, Grana Padano, etc. to taste

# Steps
- Heat olive oil in Instant Pot on saute high (medium-high heat), until shimmering
- Cook the shallot and garlic for a minute or so, until translucent but not browned
- Add rice and cook until toasted, 3-4 minutes, translucent edges and cloudy center
- Add sake and cook until the raw alcohol smell has cooked off (Kenji says 2min, in my experience it's longer)
- Stir in soy sauce and miso
- Add stock, submerge everything, cook at low pressure for 5min
- Release pressure
- Add lemon juice, stir to combine
- If it's not creamy enough (and it often isn't), set to saute low heat and stir *constantly* until it thickens (watch it doesn't stick)
- Season with salt and chives/scallions and cheese

# Notes
- The original recipe doesn't call for cheese, and adding it is a different dish (maybe a bit less subtle)
- Throwing some butter in at the end can't hurt the flavor :)
- I've had a lot of success mixing in some vegetables at the end (grilled asparagus is great, as is broccoli)
- If you throw in some grilled veggies and some grilled tofu on the side, this is a complete dish
