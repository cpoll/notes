Taking some notes from Kenji, as always. This turned out great:
- Sautee leek, carrot, rosemary, garlic, celery
- Toss in canellini, potato, green bean, 8cups of water/broth/stock.
- Toss in parmesan rind (I consider this essential)
- Simmmer 2hrs
- Boil pasta separately to keep it from getting mushy in the soup on day 2
- Throw 1cup of pasta water into pot
- Serve
