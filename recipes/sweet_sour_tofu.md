- Cut tofu into 1/2"~ cubes
- Marinade tofu in 2tbsp soy sauce, 1tbsp apple cider vinegar for at least 10min
- Pat dry, toss in bowl with paper towel, dry off, let rest
- Dust and toss with liberal cornstarch

- Bring pan to high heat, add flavorless cooking oil (canola, peanut, etc)
- Shallow fry the tofu until brown, tossing occasionally
- Empty tofu onto paper towel to drain excess oil (pat it down)

## Sweet and Sour Sauce
2 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tsp soy sauce
6 tbsp water
2 tsp cornstarch
optional lime juice, lemon juice, shanxi vinegar, etc. for adjusting

- Mix ingredients together, this is the base
